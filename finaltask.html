    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted, ground coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content, but decaffeinated coffee is also commercially available. There are also various coffee substitutes. Typically served hot, coffee has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks☕✨</p>

       <p>A cappuccino is a beloved espresso-based hot coffee drink made with layering of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam on top. The taste of cappuccinos can be described as creamy, smooth, and balanced. The combination of flavors and textures creates a delightful and comforting experience for many coffee enthusiasts.</p>
